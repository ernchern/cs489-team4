#### Additional Node Packages
We will be using the [Firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) package. Install this after your app has been created by running `npm install --save firebase`.
To make sure our survey takers will be recorded with unique ID numbers, and will not override each others answers, we will install [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) by running `npm install --save uuid`
