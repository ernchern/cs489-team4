## At least put 10 questions per person here.
*Create separate files so that we dont have conflicts.*

1. Bruce is a police officer working against the city criminals. In an action of
bringing down him, the criminals capture 2 hostages: 1 female who is also
Bruce's fiancee, and another ordinary person. They force Bruce to choose one of
the hostages, and they will kill the other one. Bruce should:
- Save his fiancee.
- Flip a coin to decide.
2. Steve, who is suffering from kidney failure, is also a strong believer in
God, and refuses to do blood transfusion. However, given his status, he would
die without taking the action. His family also insists that the transfusion is
done. As the primary doctor taking this case, you should:
- Do the transfusion.
- Respect Steve's choice.
3. You are a lawyer, and you have been assigned a client by the court. You are
supposed to represent your client to the best of your ability, regardless of
what he or she has done, even if you know they are guilty of a crime.
But the crime is the rape and murder of a child. And you have children of your
own.
Do you still defend this person to the best of your ability, or don’t you?
4. There are two patients in the hospital who needs heart transplant. The first
one is a 15 years old 'kid' who has been doing drugs and reported for several
illegal actions (stealing, violence harassment). The other one is an old lady
into her seventies, is loved by her grandchildren and is an active tennis
player. She has not finalized her will. There is only one heart left,
- Give the heart transplant to the 15 years old kid.
- Give the heart transplant to the old lady.
5. Emma is a famous celebrity, and she is recently approached by X, a medical
company, asking her to public a review (prepared by the company) about their 
new product for a lot of money, which she can use for donation (she loves
donation). Emma has never tried the product before, and does not know if the 
described content is true. She should,
- Cooperate with the company.
- Refuse the offer.
6. I promised a friend I’d meet her for lunch. Promises are ethically important.
But on the way to lunch I saw another friend who was sick — not dying, but quite
ill — and who asked me to help her get to the hospital. She could probably get 
there on her own, but is quite upset and would really like my help.
Which friend should have priority?
7. Someone is in a coma and will die once taken off life support, he has a slim 
chance of recovery, but he is also an organ donor and there are two patients 
that will die if they don't get a transplant soon. You as the closest relative 
of the comatose patient are aware of both of those things and the doctor asks 
if you want to keep the patient on life support, condemning the other two to 
die, or to let your relative die and give the other two a chance to live.
8. Charlotte is working for a tech company specialized in social network. She
recently found out that, the company is secretly collecting sensitive data of
user and sell them to other interested parties. She should:
- Report to the public.
- Remain silent.
9. Company policy forbids co-workers to become romantically involved. You go 
to the same church as someone from another department, and you find yourself 
becoming attracted to this person. Do you pursue the relationship?
10. Your best friend at school, Arthur, has been taking care of his mother at
the hospital for the last week, and is able to finish his final assignment. 
Given his score, failing to deliver the assignment would fail him the course.
However, if you miss it, you only get low grade. Arthur ask you to submit your
assignment as if it is his. Would you do so?
